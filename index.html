id="the-first-article-of-tech-bites-what-is-this-and-what-i-am-doing-here">The
first article of tech bites what is this and what I am doing here</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>A very long title that should have a question mark at its end but it
doesn’t because I don’t have an answer I don’t really what I am doing
here but I’d like to think that it’s good for me; I thought of the title
of this article and blog while I am takinga shower thought to myself if
it came to you in the bath it’s good idea thought that bites is a good
wordplay of bytes and serves a double meaning but the more I think of it
the more I see it’s dumb but I need a title so I went with it
anyway.</p>
<p>I am a tech guy my day job is a developer and I liked technology
since I was littleI am a typical nerd in this area but my nerdiness
isn’t satisfied, I know a lot(Or that how my self perception is) but I
did very little for example I always dreamt of gaining new experiences
everyday and share it through a blog/vlog, I wanted always to make some
projects to learn tools and programming languages, to try new stuff here
and there, to tinker with open source projects and contribute to them,
but we’re in the age of laziness and I must admit it I am lazy; I finish
my job sit on my couch and do nothing maybe pour a lot of time into
social media or just spend a whole night drowning in loop of endless
videos on youtube about nothing maybe interesting stuff and maybe even
not interesting.</p>
<p>So here I am making a commitment to write here every day -no promises
though- about tech stuff and whatnot maybe we’ll tinker around, Nothing
in this blog will be AI all is authentic human so you’ll find it more
funky a little-or maybe a lot- unorganized and you might find that I
didn’t readproof it and it may have some mistakes I apologize for all of
that.</p>
<h3 id="how-this-site-is-built-c-and-other-things">How this site is
built, C++ and other things</h3>
<p>As stated above I had the idea for this for so long, I always wanted
to make a yet another static site generator first to use it to generate
my site/blog. From the introduction above you probably gussed it I
haven’t made my static site generator yet so I first wrote part of this
aritcle in HTML but then told myself why am I doing this this way and
wrote markdown and generated the html with pandoc, as you know
minimalism is the new shiny thing in tech.</p>
<p>Regardless I started making a static site generator in C++, you ask
why C++ because I wanted to expand my experience in it and made a simple
todo list program in it, and thought it would be fun if my second
program was a static site generator.</p>
<p>I was this time serious in making the static site generator but I
broke my hand and didn’t finish anything, My hand is now healed thanks
for asking and I will return to it and when it’s finished I will use it
to publish this site.</p>
<h3 id="the-state-of-the-so-called-static-site-generator">The state of
the so called static site generator</h3>
<p>When I started writing it, I thought it would be good to write a C++
container that represents a tree data structure, one of the other
projects I dreamed about is writing most of the STL but since my design
for the static site generator needed a tree and there’s no tree in the
standard library of C++ it looked more and more appealing so here I am
stuck at making C++ tree iterator with segfaults here and there maybe
tomorrow It will be finished and I will share it with you, One can only
hope.</p>
<p>Thank you, If there is anyone reading this I’d be surprised I wrote
this to blow some ideas and I have a lot more I wrote it for myself to
serve as a motivation but if you are reading it kind reader I’d be very
happy to contact me on my linkedin on my github page.</p>
<h2 id="second-blog">Second blog</h2>
<p>Usually blogs have the latest entries and articles on top so you read
the latest and most relevant content in the present moment; Despite this
I oughted to continue upon the first blog/article for 2 reasons: first
it is easier in the current format(As you read above it’s all plain text
converted to plain html which you can view at
github.com/abdulla2/abdulla2.github.io) and I am lazy and didn’t want to
organize for each blog. Second The first article wasn’t complete maybe
I’ll opt for a wiki style personal site instead of a blog, I still have
ideas connected to what I wrote above so here we are in a mixture of a
blog and a personal wiki.</p>
<h3 id="the-state-of-the-tree">The state of the tree</h3>
<p>I mean of course C++ tree, I looked upon it yesterday and found that
it wasn’t building fixed the build issues and fixed a segfault but
entered an infinite loop in the iterator I made; I swear I am not a bad
developer but please notice that I was getting into C++ newely and I
haven’t used it much and I am trying to do this to understand it more;
also I don’t give much time for this it was merely a 20 minutes
yesterday remembering and fixing the issue.</p>
<h3 id="c-nullptr_t-argument-overloading">C++ nullptr_t argument
overloading</h3>
<p>I encounterd a problem yesterday that this snippet:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode c++"><code class="sourceCode cpp"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        Iter<span class="op">(</span>Tree<span class="op">*</span> node<span class="op">,</span> Iter<span class="op">*</span> parent <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">nullptr</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">:</span> <span class="va">m_node</span><span class="op">{</span>node<span class="op">},</span> <span class="va">m_curr_child</span><span class="op">(</span>node<span class="op">-&gt;</span><span class="va">m_children</span><span class="op">.</span>begin<span class="op">()),</span> <span class="va">m_parent</span><span class="op">(</span>parent<span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>crushed because I Intited the Iter node with null if it is the end()
node I thought to myself I should be able to overload the first argument
with null and I was true tried it and worked and confirmed it from the
C++ reference, a happy moment because I thought to myself ok I get it; I
get how you should treat those things in C++, so here you have it a
happy little story.</p>
<p>I will stop here give the tree a fair amount of trial to fix today
and maybe continue this afterward.</p>
<h3 id="one-20-minutes-later">One 20 minutes later</h3>
<p>Ok still not working but figured out why; as usual with modern C++ it
has to do with moving semantics lvalue rvalue and those things, turns
out I am returning a new object after each usage of operator++, I think
I need after one month of not using C++ to revise some of the advanced
things a little bit.</p>
<p>I think that’s all for today I am feeling a strong fever and I can’t
go on in anything.</p>
<p>Wish me luck.</p>
