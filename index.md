# Abdulla: Bits of Tech Bites

## The first article of tech bites what is this and what I am doing here

### Introduction

A very long title that should have a question mark at its end but it
doesn't because I don't have an answer I don't really what I am doing
here but I'd like to think that it's good for me; I thought of the
title of this article and blog while I am takinga shower thought to
myself if it came to you in the bath it's good idea thought that bites
is a good wordplay of bytes and serves a double meaning but the more I
think of it the more I see it's dumb but I need a title so I went with
it anyway.

I am a tech guy my day job is a developer and I liked technology since I
was littleI am a typical nerd in this area but my nerdiness isn't
satisfied, I know a lot(Or that how my self perception is) but I did
very little for example I always dreamt of gaining new experiences
everyday and share it through a blog/vlog, I wanted always to make some
projects to learn tools and programming languages, to try new stuff here
and there, to tinker with open source projects and contribute to them,
but we're in the age of laziness and I must admit it I am lazy; I
finish my job sit on my couch and do nothing maybe pour a lot of time
into social media or just spend a whole night drowning in loop of
endless videos on youtube about nothing maybe interesting stuff and
maybe even not interesting.

So here I am making a commitment to write here every day -no promises
though- about tech stuff and whatnot maybe we'll tinker around, Nothing
in this blog will be AI all is authentic human so you'll find it more
funky a little-or maybe a lot- unorganized and you might find that I
didn't readproof it and it may have some mistakes I apologize for all
of that.

### How this site is built, C++ and other things

As stated above I had the idea for this for so long, I always wanted to make a yet another static site generator first to use it to generate my site/blog. From the introduction above you probably gussed it I haven't made my static site generator yet so I first wrote part of this aritcle in HTML but then told myself why am I doing this this way and wrote markdown and generated the html with pandoc, as you know minimalism is the new shiny thing in tech.

Regardless I started making a static site generator in C++, you ask why C++ because I wanted to expand my  experience in it and made a simple todo list program in it, and thought it would be fun if my second program was a static site generator.

I was this time serious in making the static site generator but I broke my hand and didn't finish anything, My hand is now healed thanks for asking and I will return to it and when it's finished I will use it to publish this site.


### The state of the so called static site generator

When I started writing it, I thought it would be good to write a C++ container that represents a tree data structure, one of the other projects I dreamed about is writing most of the STL but since my design for the static site generator needed a tree and there's no tree in the standard library of C++ it looked more and more appealing so here I am stuck at making C++ tree iterator with segfaults here and there maybe tomorrow It will be finished and I will share it with you, One can only hope.

Thank you, If there is anyone reading this I'd be surprised I wrote this to blow some ideas and I have a lot more I wrote it for myself to serve as a motivation but if you are reading it kind reader I'd be very happy to contact me on my linkedin on my github page.
