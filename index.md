# Abdulla: Bits of Tech Bites

## The first article of tech bites what is this and what I am doing here

### Introduction

A very long title that should have a question mark at its end but it
doesn't because I don't have an answer I don't really what I am doing
here but I'd like to think that it's good for me; I thought of the
title of this article and blog while I am takinga shower thought to
myself if it came to you in the bath it's good idea thought that bites
is a good wordplay of bytes and serves a double meaning but the more I
think of it the more I see it's dumb but I need a title so I went with
it anyway.

I am a tech guy my day job is a developer and I liked technology since I
was littleI am a typical nerd in this area but my nerdiness isn't
satisfied, I know a lot(Or that how my self perception is) but I did
very little for example I always dreamt of gaining new experiences
everyday and share it through a blog/vlog, I wanted always to make some
projects to learn tools and programming languages, to try new stuff here
and there, to tinker with open source projects and contribute to them,
but we're in the age of laziness and I must admit it I am lazy; I
finish my job sit on my couch and do nothing maybe pour a lot of time
into social media or just spend a whole night drowning in loop of
endless videos on youtube about nothing maybe interesting stuff and
maybe even not interesting.

So here I am making a commitment to write here every day -no promises
though- about tech stuff and whatnot maybe we'll tinker around, Nothing
in this blog will be AI all is authentic human so you'll find it more
funky a little-or maybe a lot- unorganized and you might find that I
didn't readproof it and it may have some mistakes I apologize for all
of that.
